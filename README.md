# Exercism Java Track

This repository documents my work on the **Java Language Track** on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/).
The goal is to systematically deepen my Java knowledge and provide well-documented solutions as part of my portfolio.

## Goals
- Strengthen Java fundamentals and advanced concepts
- Write clean and testable code
- Implement solutions that satisfy existing JUnit tests
- Make learning progress transparent through commits and documentation

## Tech Stack
- Java 25
- JUnit 5
- Maven

## Progress
The current progress is documented in `docs/progress.md`, including the main focus areas of each exercise.
